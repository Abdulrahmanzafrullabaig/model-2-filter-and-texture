### Gaussian Filter

The Gaussian filter is a widely used linear filter in image processing and computer vision for smoothing and noise reduction. It is based on the Gaussian function, which is characterized by its bell-shaped curve. This filter works by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel, resulting in a blurred or smoothed version of the original image.

#### Definition and Mathematical Formulation

The Gaussian filter applies a Gaussian function to the image. The Gaussian function in two dimensions is defined as:

\[ G(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}} \]

where:
- \( (x, y) \) are the coordinates of a pixel in the image.
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, which controls the width of the Gaussian kernel.

#### Properties of the Gaussian Filter

1. **Smoothing Effect:** The Gaussian filter smooths the image by averaging the pixel values with a weighted average, where the weights are given by the Gaussian function. Pixels closer to the center have higher weights, leading to a smooth transition and reduced noise.

2. **Isotropic Nature:** The Gaussian filter is isotropic, meaning it treats all directions equally, leading to uniform smoothing in all directions.

3. **Parameter Control:** The degree of smoothing is controlled by the standard deviation \( \sigma \). A larger \( \sigma \) results in more blurring, while a smaller \( \sigma \) results in less blurring.

4. **Separability:** The Gaussian filter is separable, meaning a 2D Gaussian convolution can be performed using two 1D convolutions (one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis), which reduces computational complexity.

#### Implementation

To apply a Gaussian filter, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Gaussian Kernel:** Generate a 2D Gaussian kernel based on the desired standard deviation \( \sigma \) and kernel size. The kernel size is typically chosen as \( \text{kernel size} = 6\sigma + 1 \).

2. **Convolve the Image:** Convolve the image with the Gaussian kernel. This can be efficiently done using two 1D convolutions due to the separability property.

### Gabor Filter

The Gabor filter is another powerful tool in image processing and computer vision, particularly for texture analysis and edge detection. Named after Dennis Gabor, who first described them, these filters capture both spatial and frequency information, making them suitable for analyzing the texture and orientation of patterns in an image.

#### Definition and Mathematical Formulation

A Gabor filter is a linear filter whose impulse response is defined by a harmonic function (sinusoidal wave) multiplied by a Gaussian function. The Gabor filter in the spatial domain can be represented as:

\[ g(x, y; \lambda, \theta, \psi, \sigma, \gamma) = \exp\left( - \frac{x'^2 + \gamma^2 y'^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) \cos\left( 2\pi \frac{x'}{\lambda} + \psi \right) \]

where:
- \( x' = x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta) \)
- \( y' = -x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta) \)

Parameters:
- \( \lambda \) (wavelength): The wavelength of the sinusoidal factor.
- \( \theta \) (orientation): The orientation of the normal to the parallel stripes of the Gabor function.
- \( \psi \) (phase offset): The phase offset.
- \( \sigma \) (sigma/standard deviation): The standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope.
- \( \gamma \) (aspect ratio): The spatial aspect ratio, specifies the ellipticity of the support of the Gabor function.

#### Properties of the Gabor Filter

1. **Frequency and Orientation Selectivity:** Gabor filters are effective in capturing specific frequencies and orientations in an image, making them suitable for texture and edge analysis.

2. **Spatial Locality:** Due to the Gaussian envelope, Gabor filters are localized in both the spatial and frequency domains, allowing them to analyze local regions of an image.

3. **Multi-scale Analysis:** By varying the parameters \( \lambda \), \( \theta \), \( \sigma \), and \( \gamma \), Gabor filters can be used to analyze textures and patterns at multiple scales and orientations.

#### Applications

- **Texture Analysis:** Gabor filters are widely used for texture analysis and segmentation, as they can effectively capture the textural properties of an image.
- **Edge Detection:** Due to their orientation selectivity, Gabor filters are used for edge detection, capturing edges at different angles.
- **Feature Extraction:** In computer vision, Gabor filters are employed for feature extraction in tasks such as face recognition and fingerprint analysis.

#### Implementation

To apply a Gabor filter, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Gabor Kernel:** Generate a 2D Gabor kernel based on the desired parameters.
2. **Convolve the Image:** Convolve the image with the Gabor kernel to obtain the filtered image.

Here is a sample Python implementation using the `skimage` library:

### Non-Maximum Suppression

Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is a critical technique in computer vision, particularly used in edge detection and object detection tasks. It helps in thinning out the detected edges or selecting the most relevant bounding boxes by suppressing non-maximum pixels or bounding boxes.

#### Definition and Purpose

Non-Maximum Suppression aims to retain only the local maxima in the given region, thereby reducing the number of responses to the most significant ones. This technique ensures that only the strongest edges or bounding boxes are kept, while weaker ones are suppressed, resulting in a cleaner and more precise output.

#### Applications

1. **Edge Detection:**
   In edge detection algorithms like the Canny Edge Detector, NMS is used to thin out the edges. After applying gradient magnitude and direction, NMS is applied to keep only the pixels with the highest gradient magnitude in the direction of the gradient.

2. **Object Detection:**
   In object detection, multiple bounding boxes might be proposed for the same object. NMS helps in selecting the best bounding box by suppressing those with lower confidence scores or significant overlap with higher-scoring boxes.

#### Steps in Non-Maximum Suppression

##### For Edge Detection:

1. **Gradient Magnitude and Direction Calculation:**
   Calculate the gradient magnitude and direction for each pixel in the image using filters like Sobel.

2. **Suppress Non-Maximum Pixels:**
   For each pixel, compare its gradient magnitude to the magnitudes of its neighbors along the direction of the gradient. If the pixel's magnitude is not the highest, set it to zero.

##### For Object Detection:

1. **Sort Bounding Boxes:**
   Sort all bounding boxes by their confidence scores in descending order.

2. **Suppress Non-Maximum Boxes:**
   Iterate through the sorted bounding boxes and suppress any box that has a high overlap (IoU - Intersection over Union) with a previously selected box.

3. **Select the Best Boxes:**
   Keep the boxes with the highest scores and suppress the others.
